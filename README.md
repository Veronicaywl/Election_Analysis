## Election Audit Summary
As we using Python, VS Code, and Git for this module. THe challenge for me is reviewing the python code. I may wrote the script out but the errors keep coming up. Sometimes a space or the variables that we created are duplicate may cause the error. As I learn thorugh all my challenges. I am able to get the correct results. 
Tools we learned: 
- Read and extra the data from a csv file
- Perform mathematical calculation via python
- Using different data struction like list, dictionary,and tuple. 
- Using loop and if statement to filter the information as needed. 
- Write and print the data analysis result to a text file.
